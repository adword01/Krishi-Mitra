# Krishi-Mitra
An Agri Tech application by IIITIANS.

Krishi-Mitra is an Android app made in Kotlin that can help farmers predict the best crops to grow based on their location, weather conditions, and soil type. Additionally, it can suggest the appropriate fertilizers to use for each crop. The app uses machine learning algorithms to make accurate predictions.

## Features

- Crop prediction based on location, weather conditions, and soil type.
- Fertilizer suggestion for each crop based on soil type.
- Weather forecast for the next 7 days.
- User-friendly interface.

## Requirements

- Android Studio 4.0 or later.
- Android SDK 23 or later.
- Google Play services.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository 

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Build and run the project on an emulator or a physical device.

## Usage

1. Launch the app on your Android device.

2. Allow the app to access your location and other required permissions.

3. Enter your location and soil type in the app.

4. View the crop prediction and fertilizer suggestion for your location.

5. View the weather forecast 

## Krishi-Mitra-ML

[Krishi-Mitra-ML](https://github.com/0xSushmanth/Krishi-Mitra-ML) is a machine learning-based implementation for this project that utilizes a Random Forest Classifier. 
This solution is designed to provide farmers with accurate crop recommendations based on soil characteristics, weather conditions, and crop yield data, enabling them to make informed decisions for optimal crop cultivation practices.

## Krishi-Mitra-API

Krishi-Mitra-API is a Flask-based API for the Krishi-Mitra-ML project. 
It provides endpoints for making predictions using the trained Random Forest Classifier model. 
You can find the code and documentation for Krishi-Mitra-API in the 
[Krishi-Mitra-API repository](https://github.com/0xSushmanth/Krishi-Mitra-API).
